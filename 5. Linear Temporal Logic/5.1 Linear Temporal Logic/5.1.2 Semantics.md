# 5.1.2 Semantics

LTL formulae stand for properties of paths (or in fact their trace). This means that a path can either fulfill and LTL-formula or not. To precisely formulate when a path satisfies an LTL formula, we proceed as follows. First, the semantics of LTL formula $\LARGE \varphi$ is defined as a language $\large Words(\varphi)$ that contains all infinite words over the alphabet $\large 2^{AP}$ that satisfy $\LARGE \varphi$. That is, to every LTL formula a single LT property is associated. Then, the semantics is **extended** to an interpretation over paths and states of a transition system.
