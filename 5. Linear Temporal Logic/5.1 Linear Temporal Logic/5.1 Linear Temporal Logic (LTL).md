# 5.1 Linear Temporal Logic (LTL)

For reactive systems, correctness depends on the executions of the system—not only on the input and output of a computation—and on fairness issues. Temporal logic is a formalism par excellence for treating these aspects. 

Temporal logic extends propositional or predicate logic by modalities that permit to referral to the infinite behavior of reactive system. Their application to verifying complex computer systems was proposed by Pnueli in the late seventies.

The elementary temporal modalities that are present in most
temporal logics include the operators:

The underlying nature of time in temporal logics can be either linear or branching. **In the linear view, at each moment in time there is a single successor moment**. **Whereas in the branching view it has a branching, tree-like structure, where time may split into alternative courses.**

Although the term temporal suggests a relationship with the real-time behavior of a reactive system, this is only true in an abstract sense. A temporal logic allows for the speciﬁcation of the relative order of events. These modalities do allow for specifying the order in which state labels occur during an execution, or to assess that certain state labels occur inﬁnitely often in a (or all) system execution.

The underlying time domain is thus discrete, i.e., the present moment refers to the current state and the next moment corresponds to the immediate successor state. Stated diﬀerently, the system behavior is assumed to be observable at the time points 0, 1, 2, . .
