# 5.1.1 Syntax

The basic ingredients of LTL-formulae are 

- *atomic propositions* (state labels *a* ∈ AP)
- Boolean connectors like conjunction ∧, and negation ¬
- Two **basic temporal modalities**
	-  O (pronounced “next”)
	-  U (pronounced “until”)

The atomic proposition *a* ∈ AP stands for the state label *a* in a transition system. 

The $\LARGE \bigcirc$-modality is a **unary prefix** operator and requires a single LTL formula as argument. Formula $\LARGE \bigcirc  \varphi$ holds at the current moment, if $\LARGE \varphi$ holds in the next "step". 


The $\LARGE U$U-modality is a **binary infix** operator and requires two LTL formulae as argument.
