# 5.1.1 Syntax

The basic ingredients of LTL-formulae are 

- *atomic propositions* (state labels *a* ∈ AP)
- Boolean connectors like conjunction $\LARGE \wedge$ , and negation $\LARGE \neg$
- Two **basic temporal modalities**
	-  O (pronounced “next”)
	-  U (pronounced “until”)

## Next operator
The atomic proposition *a* ∈ AP stands for the state label *a* in a transition system. 

The $\LARGE \bigcirc$-modality is a **unary prefix** operator and requires a single LTL formula as argument. Formula $\LARGE \bigcirc  \varphi$ holds at the current moment, if $\LARGE \varphi$ holds in the next "step". 

Is interpreted as: The formula $\LARGE \varphi$ will be true in the **next step** or state of the system

## Until operator
The $\bigcup$-modality is a **binary infix** operator and requires two LTL formulae as argument. Formula $\LARGE {\varphi_1}\cup  \varphi_2$ holds at the current moment, if there is some future moment for which  $\LARGE \varphi_2$ holds and $\LARGE \varphi_1$ holds at all moments until that future moment.

Is interpreted as: At some point in the future, $\LARGE \varphi_2$ will be true, and until that happens, $\LARGE \varphi_1$ must be true in **all intermediate states**

## Example

$\LARGE \bigcirc$ **green**: This formula means that in the **next state**, the light will be green.

**red** $\LARGE \cup$ **green**: This formula means that **at some point in the future**, the light will be green, and **until that happens**, the light will remain red. 

## Summary
The **next** operator tells you something about what happens in the next step, while the **until** operator indicates a sequence where one condition (the first formula) holds until another condition (the second formula) becomes true in the future.

## Precedence Order
The unary operators bind stronger than the binary ones. $\LARGE \neg$ and $\LARGE \bigcirc$ bind equally strong. The temporal operator $\LARGE \cup$ takes precedence over $\LARGE \wedge$, $\LARGE \vee$, and $\LARGE \rightarrow$. Parentheses are omitted whenever appropriate, e.g., we write $\LARGE \neg\varphi_1\cup \bigcirc \varphi_2$  instead of $\LARGE (\neg\varphi_1)\cup (\bigcirc \varphi_2)$. Operator $\LARGE \cup$ is right-associative, e.g., $\LARGE \varphi_1\cup \varphi_2\cup \varphi_3$ is interpreted as $\LARGE \varphi_1\cup (\varphi_2\cup \varphi_3)$. 

## Full power of Propositional Logic

Using the Boolean connectives $\LARGE\wedge$ and $\LARGE \neg$, we can express other boolean connectives:

$$
\newcommand{\defeq}{\stackrel{\text{def}}{=}}
\begin{align*} 
\LARGE \varphi_1 \vee \varphi_2 &\quad \defeq \quad \LARGE \neg(\neg\varphi_1 \wedge \neg\varphi_2) \\

\LARGE \varphi_1 \rightarrow \varphi_2 &\quad \defeq \quad \LARGE \neg\varphi_1 \vee \varphi_2 \\ 

\LARGE \varphi_1 \leftrightarrow \LARGE \varphi_2 &\quad \defeq \quad \LARGE (\varphi_1 \rightarrow \varphi_2) \wedge (\varphi_2 \rightarrow \varphi_1) \\ 

\LARGE \varphi_1 \oplus \LARGE \varphi_2 &\quad \defeq \quad \LARGE \varphi_1 \wedge \neg\varphi_2 \vee (\varphi_2 \wedge \neg\varphi_2) \\ \end{align*}

$$

## Eventually & Always

The until operator allows to derive the **temporal modalities**:

- $\LARGE \Diamond$ ("eventually", sometimes in the future will be true)
- $\LARGE \square$ ("always" from now on forever) 
 
$\LARGE \Diamond \varphi$ ensures that $\LARGE \varphi$ will become true at some point in the future. It doesn't specify when exactly, just that it will happen eventually.

$\LARGE \square \varphi$ is satisfied if and only if it is not the case that eventually $\LARGE \neg\varphi$ holds. This is equivalent to the fact that $\LARGE \varphi$ holds from now on forever. Means that $\LARGE \varphi$ must be true at every point in the future. 

### Definitions using the until operator
As follows:
$$ \LARGE \Diamond \varphi \defeq \LARGE \text{true} \cup \varphi \quad\quad \quad\LARGE \square \varphi \defeq \LARGE \neg \Diamond \neg \varphi$$

- **Eventually**: This means that is true if there is some future point where $\LARGE \varphi$ becomes true, and until that point, the formula $\LARGE true$ (which is always true) holds.
- **Always**: This means that is true if and only if it is not the case that eventually becomes false. In other words, must be true at every point in the future.

### Example

$\LARGE \Diamond$ **Green**: Eventually, the traffic light will be green. There will a point in the future where the traffic light will turn green, but it doesn't matter when exactly.

$\LARGE \square$ **Safe**: The system is always safe from now on. The system will remain in a safe state at every moment in the future.

$\LARGE \Diamond ($**Green** $\LARGE\wedge$ $\LARGE\square$ **Safe**$\LARGE)$ : Eventually, the traffic light will turn green and from then on, the system will always be safe. 


## Intuitive Semantics of temporal modalities

## Combining $\LARGE \Diamond$ & $\LARGE \square$ 

By combining this two temporal modalities, new temporal modalities are obtained. For instance:

- $\LARGE \square\Diamond a$: Meaning "*always eventually a*" describes the (path) property stating that at any moment *j* there is a moment $\LARGE i \geq j$ at which an *a-state* is visited. This thus amounts to assert that and *a-state* is visited infinitely often. The dual modality $\LARGE \square\Diamond a$ expresses that from some moment j on, only *a-states* are visited so:

$$
\begin{align*} 

&\LARGE \square\Diamond \varphi \quad infinitely \quad often \quad \varphi  \\
\\[-9pt]
&\LARGE \Diamond\square \varphi \quad eventually \quad forever \quad \varphi  \\

\end{align*}
$$
### Always Eventually *a* (infinitely often)
This means that at any point in time, there is always a future moment when state *a* will be reached. In other words, no matter when you start observing the system, you will always find a future point where *a* **occurs**. This implies that state *a occurs* ***infinitely often***. Even if it's not happening now, it will repeatedly appear in the future.

### Eventually Always *a* (eventually forever)
This means that at some future point, the system will reach a state where it will **always** remain in state *a*. In other words, at some point, the system will enter state *a*, and from that moment on, it will **never** leave *a* again. 

### Example

$\LARGE \square\Diamond a$ where *a: The green light is on*
This means that no matter when you start observing the traffic light, there will always be a future moment where the light turns green.

The traffic light might be red or yellow at times, but **eventually**, it will always turn green again. This cycle of eventually seeing a green light happens infinitely often.

$\LARGE \Diamond\square a$ where *a: The system is fully stable (free from bugs)*
This means that, eventually, the system will reach a state where it is always stable, and from that point forward, it will never experience bugs again.

The system might experience instability or bugs initially, but there will be a moment in the future where the updates will fix everything, and from then on, the system will **always** remain in a stable state.

## Example: Traffic Light

For a traffic light with the phases "green", "red", and "yellow", the liveness property $\LARGE\square\Diamond$**green** expresses that the traffic light is infinitely often green. The requirement *"once red, the light cannot become green immediately"* can be expressed by the LTL formula:
$$
\large \square(red \rightarrow \neg\bigcirc green)
$$
The requirement *"once red, the light always become green eventually after being yellow for some time"* is expressed by

$$
\large \square (red \rightarrow \bigcirc (red  \cup (yellow \wedge \bigcirc (yellow \cup green)) ))
$$
