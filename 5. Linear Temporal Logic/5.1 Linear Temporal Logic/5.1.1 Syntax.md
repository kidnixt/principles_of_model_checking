# 5.1.1 Syntax

The basic ingredients of LTL-formulae are 

- *atomic propositions* (state labels *a* ∈ AP)
- Boolean connectors like conjunction $\LARGE \wedge$ , and negation $\LARGE \neg$
- Two **basic temporal modalities**
	-  O (pronounced “next”)
	-  U (pronounced “until”)

## Next operator
The atomic proposition *a* ∈ AP stands for the state label *a* in a transition system. 

The $\LARGE \bigcirc$-modality is a **unary prefix** operator and requires a single LTL formula as argument. Formula $\LARGE \bigcirc  \varphi$ holds at the current moment, if $\LARGE \varphi$ holds in the next "step". 

Is interpreted as: The formula $\LARGE \varphi$ will be true in the **next step** or state of the system

## Until operator
The $\bigcup$-modality is a **binary infix** operator and requires two LTL formulae as argument. Formula $\LARGE {\varphi_1}\cup  \varphi_2$ holds at the current moment, if there is some future moment for which  $\LARGE \varphi_2$ holds and $\LARGE \varphi_1$ holds at all moments until that future moment.

Is interpreted as: At some point in the future, $\LARGE \varphi_2$ will be true, and until that happens, $\LARGE \varphi_1$ must be true in **all intermediate states**

## Example

$\LARGE \bigcirc$ **green**: This formula means that in the **next state**, the light will be green.

**red** $\LARGE \cup$ **green**: This formula means that **at some point in the future**, the light will be green, and **until that happens**, the light will remain red. 

## Summary
The **next** operator tells you something about what happens in the next step, while the **until** operator indicates a sequence where one condition (the first formula) holds until another condition (the second formula) becomes true in the future.

## Precedence Order
The unary operators bind stronger than the binary ones. $\LARGE \neg$ and $\LARGE \bigcirc$ bind equally strong. The temporal operator $\LARGE \cup$ takes precedence over $\LARGE \wedge$, $\LARGE \vee$, and $\LARGE \rightarrow$. Parentheses are omitted whenever appropriate, e.g., we write $\LARGE \neg\varphi_1\cup \bigcirc \varphi_2$  instead of $\LARGE (\neg\varphi_1)\cup (\bigcirc \varphi_2)$. Operator $\LARGE \cup$ is right-associative, e.g., $\LARGE \varphi_1\cup \varphi_2\cup \varphi_3$ is interpreted as $\LARGE \varphi_1\cup (\varphi_2\cup \varphi_3)$. 

## Full power of Propositional Logic

Using the Boolean connectives $\LARGE\wedge$ and $\LARGE \neg$, we can express other boolean connectives:

$$
\newcommand{\defeq}{\stackrel{\text{def}}{=}}
\begin{align*} 
\LARGE \varphi_1 \vee \varphi_2 &\quad \defeq \quad \LARGE \neg(\neg\varphi_1 \wedge \neg\varphi_2) \\

\LARGE \varphi_1 \rightarrow \varphi_2 &\quad \defeq \quad \LARGE \neg\varphi_1 \vee \varphi_2 \\ 

\LARGE \varphi_1 \leftrightarrow \LARGE \varphi_2 &\quad \defeq \quad \LARGE (\varphi_1 \rightarrow \varphi_2) \wedge (\varphi_2 \rightarrow \varphi_1) \\ 

\LARGE \varphi_1 \oplus \LARGE \varphi_2 &\quad \defeq \quad \LARGE \varphi_1 \wedge \neg\varphi_2 \vee (\varphi_2 \wedge \neg\varphi_2) \\ \end{align*}

$$

The until operator allows to derive the **temporal modalities**:
