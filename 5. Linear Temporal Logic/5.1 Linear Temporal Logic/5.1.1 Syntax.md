# 5.1.1 Syntax

The basic ingredients of LTL-formulae are 

- *atomic propositions* (state labels *a* ∈ AP)
- Boolean connectors like conjunction ∧, and negation ¬
- Two **basic temporal modalities**
	-  O (pronounced “next”)
	-  U (pronounced “until”)

The atomic proposition *a* ∈ AP stands for the state label *a* in a transition system. 

The $\LARGE \bigcirc$-modality is a **unary prefix** operator and requires a single LTL formula as argument. Formula $\LARGE \bigcirc  \varphi$ holds at the current moment, if $\LARGE \varphi$ holds in the next "step". 

Is interpreted as: The formula $\LARGE \varphi$ will be true in the **next step** or state of the system

The $\bigcup$-modality is a **binary infix** operator and requires two LTL formulae as argument. Formula $\LARGE {\varphi_1}\cup  \varphi_2$ holds at the current moment, if there is some future moment for which  $\LARGE \varphi_2$ holds and $\LARGE \varphi_1$ holds at all moments until that future moment.

Is interpreted as: At some point in the future, $\LARGE \varphi_2$ will be true, and until that ha
