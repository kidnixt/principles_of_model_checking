# 5.1.1 Syntax

The basic ingredients of LTL-formulae are 

- *atomic propositions* (state labels *a* ∈ AP)
- Boolean connectors like conjunction $\LARGE \wedge$ , and negation $\LARGE \neg$
- Two **basic temporal modalities**
	-  O (pronounced “next”)
	-  U (pronounced “until”)

## Next operator
The atomic proposition *a* ∈ AP stands for the state label *a* in a transition system. 

The $\LARGE \bigcirc$-modality is a **unary prefix** operator and requires a single LTL formula as argument. Formula $\LARGE \bigcirc  \varphi$ holds at the current moment, if $\LARGE \varphi$ holds in the next "step". 

Is interpreted as: The formula $\LARGE \varphi$ will be true in the **next step** or state of the system

## Until operator
The $\bigcup$-modality is a **binary infix** operator and requires two LTL formulae as argument. Formula $\LARGE {\varphi_1}\cup  \varphi_2$ holds at the current moment, if there is some future moment for which  $\LARGE \varphi_2$ holds and $\LARGE \varphi_1$ holds at all moments until that future moment.

Is interpreted as: At some point in the future, $\LARGE \varphi_2$ will be true, and until that happens, $\LARGE \varphi_1$ must be true in **all intermediate states**

## Example

$\LARGE \bigcirc$ **green**: This formula means that in the **next state**, the light will be green.

**red** $\LARGE \cup$ **green**: This formula means that **at some point in the future**, the light will be green, and **until that happens**, the light will remain red. 

## Summary
The **next** operator tells you something about what happens in the next step, while the **until** operator indicates a sequence where one condition (the first formula) holds until another condition (the second formula) becomes true in the future.

## Precedence Order
The unary operators bind stronger than the binary ones. $\LARGE \neg$ and $\LARGE \bigcirc$ bind equally strong. The temporal operator
