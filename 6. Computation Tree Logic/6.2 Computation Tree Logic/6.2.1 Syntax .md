# 6.2.1 Syntax

**CTL** has a two-stage syntax where formulae in CTL are classified into ***state and path formulae***. The former are assertions about the atomic propositions in the states and their branching structure, while path formulae express temporal properties of paths. Compared to LTL formulae, path formulae in CTL are simpler: as in LTL they are built by the next-step and until operators, but they must not be combined with boolean connectives and **no nesting of temporal modalities is allowed.**

CTL *state formulae* over the set AP of atomic proposition are formed according to the following grammar:

Where $\large a \in AP$ and $\large \varphi$ is a path formula. 

CTL *path formulae* are formed according to the following grammar:
