# 6.2.1 Syntax

**CTL** has a two-stage syntax where formulae in CTL are classified into ***state and path formulae***. The former are assertions about the atomic propositions in the states and their branching structure, while path formulae express temporal properties of paths. Compared to LTL formulae, path formulae in CTL are simpler: as in LTL they are built by the next-step and until operators, but they must not be combined with boolean connectives and **no nesting of temporal modalities is allowed.**

CTL *state formulae* over the set AP of atomic proposition are formed according to the following grammar: 

![[Pasted image 20240912174619.png]]

Where $\large a \in AP$ and $\large \varphi$ is a path formula. 

CTL *path formulae* are formed according to the following grammar:

![[Pasted image 20240912174930.png]]

Where $\large \Phi , \Phi_1$ and $\large \Phi_2$  are state formulae.

**Greek capital letters** will denote CTL state formulae (CTL formulae, for short), whereas **lowercase Greek letters** will denote CTL path formulae.

## State & Path formulae

CTL distinguishes between state formulae and path formulae. Intuitively, state formulae express a property of a state, while path formulae express a property of a path, i.e., an infinite sequence of states. 

The temporal operators $\large \bigcirc$ and $\bigcup$ have the same meaning as in LTL and are **path operators**. Formula $\large \bigcirc  \Phi$ holds for a path if $\large \Phi$ holds at the next state in the path.

And $\large \Phi \cup \Psi$ holds for a path if there is some state along the path for which  $\large \Psi$ holds, and $\large \Phi$ holds in all states prior to that state. 

Path formulae **can be turned into state formulae** by prefixing them with either:

- The path quantifier $\large \exists$ (pronounced "for some path").
- Or the path quantifier $\large \forall$ (pronounced "for all paths").


> Note that the **lineal temporal operators** $\large \bigcirc$ and $\bigcup$ are required to be immediately preceded by $\large \exists$ or $\large \forall$ to obtain a legal state formula.

Formula $\large \exists \varphi$ holds in a state if there exists *some* path satisfying $\Large \varphi$ that starts in that states. Dually $\large \forall \varphi$ holds in a state if *all* paths that start in that state satisfy $\Large \varphi$.
