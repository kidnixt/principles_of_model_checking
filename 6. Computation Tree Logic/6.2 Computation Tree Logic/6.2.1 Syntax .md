# 6.2.1 Syntax

**CTL** has a two-stage syntax where formulae in CTL are classified into ***state and path formulae***. The former are assertions about the atomic propositions in the states and their branching structure, while path formulae express temporal properties of paths. Compared to LTL formulae, path formulae in CTL are simpler: as in LTL they are built by the next-step and until operators, but they must not be combined with boolean connectives and **no nesting of temporal modalities is allowed.**

CTL *state formulae* over the set AP of atomic proposition are formed according to the following grammar:

Where $\large a \in AP$ and $\large \varphi$ is a path formula. 

CTL *path formulae* are formed according to the following grammar:

Where $\large \Phi , \Phi_1$ and $\large \Phi_2$  are state formulae.

**Greek capital letters** will denote CTL state formulae (CTL formulae, for short), whereas **lowercase Greek letters** will denote CTL path formulae.

## State & Path formulae

CTL distinguishes between state formulae and path formulae. Intuitively, state formulae express a property of a state, while path formulae express a property of a path, i.e., an infinite sequence of states. 

The temporal operators $\large \bigcirc$ and $\bigcup$ have the same meaning as in LTL and are **path operators**. Formula  $\large \bigcirc  \Phi$ holds for a path if
