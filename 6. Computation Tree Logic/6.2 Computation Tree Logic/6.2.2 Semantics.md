# 6.2.2 Semantics

CTL formulae are interpreted over the states and paths of a transition system TS. Formally, given a transition system TS, the semantics of CTL formulae is defined by **two** satisfaction relations (both denoted by $\large \models$): one for the state formulae and one for the path formulae.

- For the state formulae, $\large \models$ is a relation between the states in TS and state formulae. We write $\large s \models \Phi$ rather than $(\large s,\Phi) \in \;\models$. The intended interpretation is: $\large s \models \Phi$ if and only if state formula $\large \Phi$ holds in state $\large s$ 
- For the path formulae, $\large \models$ is a relation between maximal path fragments in TS and path formulae. We write $\large \pi \models \Phi$ rather than $(\large \pi,\Phi) \in \;\models$. The intended interpretation is: $\large \pi \models \varphi$ if and only if path $\large \pi$ satisfies path formula $\large \varphi$ 

## Satisfaction Relation for CTL

Let $\large a \in AP$ be an atomic proposition, $\large TS = (S, Act, \rightarrow, I, AP, L)$ be a transition system without terminal states, state $\large s \in S, \Phi, \Psi$ be CTL state formulae, and $\large \varphi$ be a CTL path formula. The satisfaction relation $\large \models$ is defined for **state formulae by**.

$$
\large
\begin{align*}
    s\quad &\models \quad\text{a} \quad  &\text{iff} \quad &a \in L(s) \\

	s \quad &\models \quad\neg \Phi \quad &\text{iff} \quad &s \not\models \Phi \\

    
    s \quad &\models \quad\Phi \land \Psi \quad &\text{iff} \quad &(s \models \Phi) \; \text{and} \; (s \models \Psi) \\

	s \quad &\models \quad\exists\varphi \quad &\text{iff} \quad &\pi \models \varphi \;\; \text{for some} \;\;\pi \in Paths(s) \\
	
    s \quad &\models \quad\forall\varphi \quad &\text{iff} \quad &\pi \models \varphi \;\; \text{for all} \;\;\pi \in Paths(s) \\
\end{align*}

$$

For path $\Large \pi$, the satisfaction relation $\large \models$  for path formulae is defined by:

$$
\large
\begin{align*}


	\pi \quad &\models \quad\bigcirc\Phi \quad&\text{iff} \quad &\pi[1] \models \Phi\\
    
    \pi \quad &\models \quad\Phi \cup \Psi \quad &\text{iff} \quad &\exists j \geq 0. (\pi [j] \models \Psi \wedge (\forall \;0 \geq k \gt j. \pi [k] \models \Phi)) \\

\end{align*}

$$

where for path $\Large\pi = s_0s_1s_2\dots$ and integer $\large i \geq 0, \pi[i]$ denotes the $\large (i+1)th$ state of $ path $\Large\pi$, i.e., $\large \pi[i] = s_i$  
.

---

The interpretation for atomic propositions, negation, and conjunction are as usual, where it should be noted that in **CTL they are interpreted over states, where in LTL they are interpreted over paths**. 

State formula $\large \exists\varphi$ is valid in state *s* if and only if there exists some path starting in *s* that satisfies $\large\varphi$. In contrast, $\large\forall\varphi$ is valid in state *s* if and only if all paths starting in *s* satisfy $\large\varphi$.

The semantics of the path formulae is identical to that for LTL. For instance $\large\exists\bigcirc\Phi$ is valid in state *s* if and only if there **exists some path $\Large\pi$ starting in *s* such that in the next state of this path, state $\Large\pi[1]$, the property $\large\Phi$ holds**. This is equivalent to the existence of a direct successor *sÂ´* of *s* such that $\large s' \models \Phi$ 

$\large\forall(\Phi\cup\Psi)$ is valid in state *s* if and only if every path starting in *s* has an initial finite prefix (possibly only containing *s*) such that $\large\Psi$ holds in the last state of this prefix and $\large\Phi$ holds in tall other states along the prefix.
