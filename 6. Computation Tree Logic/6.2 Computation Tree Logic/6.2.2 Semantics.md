# 6.2.2 Semantics

CTL formulae are interpreted over the states and paths of a transition system TS. Formally, given a transition system TS, the semantics of CTL formulae is defined by **two** satisfaction relations (both denoted by $\large \models$): one for the state formulae and one for the path formulae.

- For the state formulae, $\large \models$ is a relation between the states in TS and state formulae. We write $\large s \models \Phi$ rather than $(\large s,\Phi) \in \;\models$. The intended interpretation is: $\large s \models \Phi$ if and only if state formula $\large \Phi$ holds in state $\large s$ 
- For the path formulae, $\large \models$ is a relation between maximal path fragments in TS and path formulae. We write $\large \pi \models \Phi$ rather than $(\large \pi,\Phi) \in \;\models$. The intended interpretation is: $\large \pi \models \varphi$ if and only if path $\large \pi$ satisfies path formula $\large \varphi$
