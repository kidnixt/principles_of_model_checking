# Computation Tree Logic (CTL)

A prominent branching temporal logic for specifying system properties. The **core recursive algorithm** is presented that is basd on a *bottom-up* traversal of the parse tree of the formula at hand. This is followed by an algorithm for the generation of counterexamples.

**LTL** is called linear, because the ***qualitative notion of time is path-based*** and viewed to be linear: at each moment of time there is *only one possible successor* state and thus each time moment has a unique possible future. Technically speaking, this follows from the fact that the interpretation of LTL formulae is defined in terms of path, i.e., sequence of states.

Paths themselves, though, are obtained from a transition system that might be **branching: a state may have several, distinct direct successor states**, and thus several computations may start in a state.
