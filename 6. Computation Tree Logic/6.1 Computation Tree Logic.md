# Computation Tree Logic (CTL)

A prominent branching temporal logic for specifying system properties. The **core recursive algorithm** is presented that is basd on a *bottom-up* traversal of the parse tree of the formula at hand. This is followed by an algorithm for the generation of counterexamples.

**LTL** is called linear, because the ***qualitative notion of time is path-based*** and viewed to be linear: at each moment of time there is *only one possible successor* state and thus each time moment has a unique possible future. Technically speaking, this follows from the fact that the interpretation of LTL formulae is defined in terms of path, i.e., sequence of states.

Paths themselves, though, are obtained from a transition system that might be **branching: a state may have several, distinct direct successor states**, and thus several computations may start in a state.  

The interpretation of LTL-formulae in a state requires that a formula $\LARGE \varphi$ holds in state *s* if *all* possible computations that start in *s* satisfy $\LARGE \varphi$. The universal quantification over all computations that is implicit in the LTL semantics can also be made explicit in the formula, e.g.:

$\large s \models \forall\varphi$ if and only iff $\large\pi  \models \varphi$ for all paths $\large\pi$ starting in $\large s$

In LTL, we thus can state properties over all possible computations that start in a state, but not easily about *some* of such computations. To some extent this may be overcome by exploiting the duality between universal and existential quantification. For instance, to check whether $\large s \models\forall\neg\varphi$: if this formula is not satisfied by *s*, then there must be a computation that meets $\LARGE \varphi$, otherwise they should all refute $\LARGE \varphi$.

For more complicated properties, like "for every computation it is always possible to return to the initial state", this is, however, not possible. A naive attempt would be to require $\LARGE \square\Diamond start$ for every computation, i.e., $\large s\models\forall\square\Diamond start$, where the proposition *start* uniquely identifies the initial state. This is, however, too strong as it requires a computation to *always* return to the initial state, not just *possibly*. Other attempts to specify the intended property also fail, and it even turns out to be the case that the property cannot be specified in LTL.

To overcome these problems, in the early eighties another strand of temporal logics for specification and verification purposes was introduced. The semantics of this kind of temporal logic is not based on a linear notion of time —an infinite sequence of states— but on a *branching* notion of time—an infinite *tree* of states.

Branching time refers to the fact that at each moment there may be several different possible futures. Each moment of time may thus split into several possible futures. The semantics of a branching temporal logic is defined in terms of an infinite, directed *tree* of states rather than an infinite sequence.

**Each traversal of the tree starting in its root represents a single path**. The tree itself thus represents all possible paths,
