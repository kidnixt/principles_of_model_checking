# Reward-based Properties

PRISM models can be augmented with information about [[0.1.12 Costs & Rewards| rewards]](or, equivalently, costs). The tool can analyse properties which relate to the *expected values* of these rewards. This is achieved using the **R operator**, which works in a similar fashion to the [[0.2.3 The P Operator| P]]and [[0.2.6 The S Operator| S]]operators, and can be used either in a Boolean-valued query, e.g.:

```c
R bound [ rewardprop ]
```

where `bound`takes the form `<r`, `<=r`, `>r` or `>=r` for an expression `r` evaluating to a non-negative double, or a real-valued query, e.g.:

```c
R query [ rewardprop ]
```

where `query` is `=?`, `min=?` or `max=?`. In the latter case, filters can be used, as for the **P** and **S** operators.

Informally, **R**` bound [ rewardprop ]` is true in a state of a model if "the expected reward associated with `rewardprop` of the model when starting from that state'' meets the bound `bound` and **R** `query [ rewardprop ]` returns the actual expected reward value.

There are various different types of reward properties:

- **"reachability reward":** **F** `prop`
- **"co-safe LTL reward"**: e.g. **F** (`prop1 &` **F** `prop2`)
- **"cumulative reward"**: **C**<=`t`
- **"total reward"**: **C**
- **"instantaneous reward"**: **I** =t
- **"steady-state reward"**: **S**

Below, we consider each of these cases in turn. The descriptions here are kept relatively informal. Precise definitions for most of these can be found in, for example, [KNP07a](https://www.prismmodelchecker.org/manual/Main/References#KNP07a) (for DTMCs and CTMCs) or [FKNP11 ](https://prismmodelchecker.org/manual/Main/References#FKNP11)(for MDPs)
