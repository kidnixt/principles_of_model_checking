# Non-probabilistic Properties

PRISM also supports model checking of the non-probabilistic temporal logics [[6.2.1 Syntax | CTL]](computation tree logic) and [[5.1 Linear Temporal Logic (LTL)| LTL]](linear temporal logic). Properties in these logics use the **A operator** (for all), and **E operator** (there exists), instead of the probabilistic **P operator** used in many other properties supported by PRISM.

Properties take the form:
```c
A [pathpropt]
E [pathpropt]
```

which are true in a state **s** of a model if "path property `pathprop`is satisfied by **all** paths from sate **s**", and "path property `pathprop`is satisfied by **some** path from state **s**", respectively. The syntax for LTL formulas is the same as those allowed within the [[0.2.3 The P Operator| P operator]]

Example properties include:

```c
E [ F "goal" ]
// There exists a path that reaches a state satisfying "goal"
```


```c
A [ G x<=10 ] // Variable x is always at most 10 along all paths of the model
```
