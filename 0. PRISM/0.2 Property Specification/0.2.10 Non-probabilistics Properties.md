# Non-probabilistic Properties

PRISM also supports model checking of the non-probabilistic temporal logics [[6.2.1 Syntax of CTL|CTL]](computation tree logic) and [[5.1 Linear Temporal Logic (LTL)| LTL]](linear temporal logic). Properties in these logics use the **A operator** (for all), and **E operator** (there exists), instead of the probabilistic **P operator** used in many other properties supported by PRISM.

Properties take the form:
```c
A [pathpropt]
E [pathpropt]
```

which are true in a state **s** of a model if "path property `pathprop`is satisfied by **all** paths from sate **s**", and "path property `pathprop`is satisfied by **some** path from state **s**", respectively. The syntax for LTL formulas is the same as those allowed within the [[0.2.3 The P Operator| P operator]]

Example properties include:

```c
E [ F "goal" ]
// There exists a path that reaches a state satisfying "goal"
```


```c
A [ G x<=10 ] 
// Variable x is always at most 10 along all paths of the model
```


```c
E [ F "ready" & (X "launch") ] 
// There exists a path along which label "ready" eventually becomes true and label "launch" is true immediately afterwards
```


```c
A [ (G F x=1) | (G F x=2) ] 
// Along all paths, either x=1 or x=2 is true infinitely often
```

## Counterexamples and Witnesses

If you check a CTL property of the form `A [ G "inv" ]` and it is false, PRISM will generate a counterexample in the form of a path that reaches a state where `"inv"` is not true. This is displayed either in the simulator (from the GUI) or at the command-line. Similarly, if you check `E [ F "goal" ]` and the result is true, a witness (a path reaching a `"goal"` state) will be generated.
