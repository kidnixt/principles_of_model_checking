# Properties Files

## Constants
Files containing properties to be analysed by PRISM can also contain constants, as is the case for model files. These are defined in identical fashion, for example:

```c
const int k = 7;  
const double T = 9.5;  
const double p = 0.01;  
  
P<p [ F<=T x=k ];
```

In fact, values such as the probability bounds for the **P** or **S** operators (like **P** above) and upper or lower bounds for the `**U**` operator (like `T` above) can be arbitrary expressions, provided they are constant. Furthermore, expressions in the properties file can also refer to constants previous defined in the model file.
