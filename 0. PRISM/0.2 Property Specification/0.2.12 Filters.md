# Filters
As discussed above, when reporting the result of model checking a property, **PRISM will by default return the value for the (single) initial state of the model**. However, since PRISM in fact usually *has to compute values for all state simultaneously*, you can customise PRISM properties to obtain different results. This is done using **filters.** 

Filters are created using the `filter`keyword. They take the following form:

```c
filter(op, prop, states)
```

where `op`is the **filter operator** (see below), `prop`is any PRISM property and `states`is a Boolean-valued expression identifying a set of states over which to apply the filter.

In fact, the `states`argument is optional; if ommited, the filter is applied **over all states**. So, the following properties are equivalent:

```c
filter (op, prop)
filter (op, prop, true)
```

Here's a simple example of a filter:

```c
filter(max, P=? [ F "error" ], x = 0)
```

This gives the *maximum* value, starting from any state satisfying x = 0, of the probability of reaching an "error" state.

Here's another simple example, which check whether, ***starting* from any reachable state, we eventually, reach a "done" state with probability 1**

```c
filter(forall, P>=1 [ F "done" ])
```

We could modify this property slightly to instead check whether, from any state that satisfies the label "ready", we eventually reach a "done" state with probability 1. This could be done with either of the following two properties: 


```c
filter (forall, "ready" => P>=1 [ F "done" ])
filter (forall, P >=1 [ F "done" ], "ready")
```

## Types of filter
Most filters of the form `filter (op, prop, states)`apply some operator `op`to the values of property `prop`for all the states satisfying `states`, resulting in a single value. The full list of filter operators `op`in this category is:

- `min`: the minimum value of `prop` over states satisfying `states`
- `max`: the maximum value of `prop` over states satisfying `states`
- `count`: counts the number of states satisfying `states` for which `prop` is true
- `sum` (or `+`): sums the value of `prop` for states satisfying `states`
- `avg`: the average value of `prop` over states satisfying `states`
- `first`: the value of `prop` for the first (lowest-indexed) state satisfying `states`
- `range`: the range (interval) of values of `prop` over states satisfying `states`
- `forall` (or `&`): returns `true` if `prop` is `true` for all states satisfying `states`
- `exists` (or `|`): returns `true` if `prop` is `true` for some states satisfying `states`
- `state`: returns the value for the single state satisfying `states` (if there is more than one, this is an error)

There are also a few filters that, rather than returning a single value, return different values for each state, like a normal PRISM property:

- `argmin`: returns `true` for the states satisfying `states` that yield the minimum value of `prop`
- `argmax`: returns `true` for the states satisfying `states` that yield the maximum value of `prop`
- `print`: does not change the result of `prop` but prints the (non-zero) values to the log
- `printall`: like `print`, but displays _all_ values, even for states where the value is zero

## More Examples

Here are some further illustrative examples of properties that use filters.

Filters provide a quick way to *print* the results of a model checking query for several states. In most cases, for example, a P=? query just return the probability **from the initial state**. To see the probability for all states satisfying x>2, use:

```c
filter(print, P=? [...], x>2)
```
