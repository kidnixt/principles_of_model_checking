# Filters
As discussed above, when reporting the result of model checking a property, **PRISM will by default return the value for the (single) initial state of the model**. However, since PRISM in fact usually *has to compute values for all state simultaneously*, you can customise PRISM properties to obtain different results. This is done using **filters.** 

Filters are created using the `filter`keyword. They take the following form:

```c
filter(op, prop, states)
```

where `op`is the **filter operator** (see below), `prop`is any PRISM property and `states`is a Boolean-valued expression identifying a set of states over which to apply the filter.

In fact, the `states`argument is optional; if ommited, the filter is applied **over all states**. So, the following properties are equivalent:

```c
filter (op, prop)
filter (op, prop, true)
```

Here's a simple example of a filter:

```c
filter(max, P=? [ F "error" ], x = 0)
```

This gives the *maximum* value, starting from any state satisfying x = 0, of the probability of reaching an "error" state.

Here's another simple example, which check whether, ***starting* from any reachable state, we eventually, reach a "done" state with probability 1**

```c
filter(forall, P>=1 [ F "done" ])
```

We could modify this property slightly to instead check whether, from any state
