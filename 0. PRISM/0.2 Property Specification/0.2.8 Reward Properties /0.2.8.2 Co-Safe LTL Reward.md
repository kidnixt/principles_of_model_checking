# Co-Safe LTL Reward

These generalise the "reachability" properties above. Again, reward accumulated along a path up until some point, but this is specified in a more general way, by giving a formula in the co-safe fragment of linear temporal logic ([[5.1 Linear Temporal Logic |LTL]]). Rewards are accumulated  up until the point where the formula is first satisfied. For example, this property, for a DTMC or CTMC, queries the expected reward accumulated until first `goal`equals 1 an then subsequently `goal`equals 2:

```c
R=? [ F (goal=1 & F goal=2) ]
```

and this property, for an MDP, minimises the expected reward until `loc`equals 1, having passed only through states where `lol`never equals 4:

```c
Rmin=? [ loc!=4 U loc=1 ]
```

**As for reachability rewards, if the probability of satisfying the formula is less than 1, then the expected reward is defined to be infinite.**

Intuitively, a _co-safe_ formula is one that is satisfied within a finite period of time, and remains true for ever once it becomes true for the first time. For simplicity, PRISM actually supports the _syntactic_ co-safe fragment of LTL, which is defined as any LTL formula that only uses the temporal operators **F**, **U** and **X** (but not **G**, for example).
