# Co-Safe LTL Reward

These generalise the "reachability" properties above. Again, reward accumulated along a path up until some point, but this is specified in a more general way, by giving a formula in the co-safe fragment of linear temporal logic ([[5.1 Linear Temporal Logic |LTL]]). Rewards are accumulated  up until the point where the formula is first satisfied. For example, this property, for a DTMC or CTMC, queries the expected reward accumulated until first `goal`equals 1 an then subsequently `goal`equals 2:

```c
R=? [ F (goal=1 & F goal=2) ]
```
