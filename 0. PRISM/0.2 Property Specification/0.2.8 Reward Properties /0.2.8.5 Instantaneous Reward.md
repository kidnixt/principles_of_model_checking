# Instanteneous Reward

"Instanteneous reward" properties refer to the reward of a model at a particular instant in time. The reward property `I=t`associates with a path the reward in the state of that path when exactly `t`time units have elapsed. 

Returning to our example form the previous section of a model for a disk-request queue in a disk-drive controller, consider the case where the rewards assigned to each state of the model give the current size of the queue in that state. Then, the following property:

```c
R<4.4 [I=100]
```

would be true in a state **s** of the model if "starting from **s**, the expected queue size exactly 100 time units later is less than 4.4".
