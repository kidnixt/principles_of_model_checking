# Cumulative Reward

"Cumulative reward" properties also associate a reward with each path of a model, but only up to a given time bound. The property *C<=t* corresponds to the reward cumulated along a path until `t`time units have elapsed. For DTMCs and MDPs, the bound `t`must evaluate to an integer; for CTMCs, it can evaluate to doulbe. 

A typical application of this type of property is the following. Consider a model of a disk-drive controller which includes a queue of incoming disk requests. If we assign a reward of 1 to each transition of the model corresponding to the situation where an incoming request is lost because the queue is full, then the property:

```c
R=? [C>=15.5]
```

would return, for a given state of the model, "the expected number of lost requests within 15.5 time units of operation".
