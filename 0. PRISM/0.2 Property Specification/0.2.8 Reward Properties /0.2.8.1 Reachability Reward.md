# Reachability Reward

"Reachability reward" properties associate a reward with each path of a model. More specifically, they refer to the reward accumulated along a path until a certain point is reached.

The manner in which rewards are accumulated depends on the model type. For DTMCs and MDPs, the total reward for a path is the sum of the state rewards for each state along the path plus the sum of the transition rewards for each transition between these states. 

The reward property `F prop`corresponds to the reward accumulated along a path until a state satisfying property `prop`is reached, where rewards are accumulated as described above. State rewards for the `prop`-satisfying state reached are not included in the cumulated value. In the case were the probability of reaching a state satisfying `prop`is less than 1, the reward is equal to infinity. 

A common application of this type of property is the case when the rewards associated with the model correspond to time. One can then state, for example:

```c
R<=9.5 [ F z=2 ]
```

which is true in a state **s** if "the expected time taken to reach, from *s*, a state w"
