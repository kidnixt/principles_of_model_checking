# Total Reward

"Total reward" properties refer to the accumulation of state and transition rewards in the same way as for "reachability reward" and "cumulative reward" properties, but the rewards is accumulated indefinitely, i.e. the total reward accumulated along the whole (infinite) path. Note that this means that, unless a path ends up remaining forever in states with zero, the total reward will be infinite.

Re-using the reward structure in the previous example,

```c
R=? [C]
```

returns "the expected total number of lost requests"
