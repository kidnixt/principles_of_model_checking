# Which reward structure?

In the case where a PRISM model has multiple [[0.1.12 Costs & Rewards | reward structures]]you may need to specify which reward structure your property refers to. This is done by placing the information in braces ({}) after the **R operator**. You can do so either using the name assigned to a reward structure (if any) or using the index (where `1`means the first rewards structure in the PRISM model file, `2` the second, etc). Examples are:

```c
R{"num_failures"}=? [ C<=10.0 ]  
R{"time"}=? [ F step=final ]  
R{2}=? [ F step=final ]
```

Note than when using and index to specify the reward structure, you can actually put any expression that evaluates to an integer. 

This allows you to, for example, write a property of the form `R{c}=?[...]` where `c` is an undefined integer constant. You can then vary the value of `c` in an experiment and compute values for several different reward structures at once.

If you don't specify a reward structure to the **R operator**, by default, the first one in the model file is used.
