# The P Operator

One of the most important operators in the PRISM property specification language is the **P operator**, which is used to reason about the probability of an event's occurrence. This operator was originally proposed in the logic *PCTL* but also features in the other logics supported by PRISM, such as *CSL*. The **P operator** is applicable to all types of models supported by PRISM.
