# Syntax & Semantics

# Syntax

The syntax of the PRISM property specification language subsumes various probabilistic temporal logics, including PCTL, CSL, (probabilistic) [[5.1 Linear Temporal Logic (LTL)| LTL]], PCTL* and [[6.2.1 Syntax | CTL]]

Informally, the syntax can be summarised as follows: a property can be any valid, well-typed PRISM [[0.1.7 Expressions| expression]]which (optionallu) also includes the probabilistic operators discussed previously (**P, S** and **R**) and the non-probabilistic (CTL) ones (**A** and **E**). This mean that any of the following operators can be used:

- `-` (unary minus)
- `*`, `/` (multiplication, division)
- `+`, `-` (addition, subtraction)
- `<`, `<=`, `>=`, `>` (relational operators)
- `=`, `!=` (equality operators)
- `!` (negation)
- `&` (conjunction)
- `|` (disjunction)
- `<=>` (if-and-only-if)
- `=>` (implication)
- `?` (condition evaluation: `condition ? a : b` means "if `condition` is true then `a` else `b`")
- **P** (probabilistic operator)
- **S** (steady-state operator)
- **R** (reward operator)
- **A** (for-all operator)
- **E** (there-exists operator)



This allows you to write any property expressible in logics such as PCTL and CSL. For example, CSL allows you to nest **P** and **S** operators:

```c
P=? [ F>2 S>0.9[ num_servers >= 5 ] ]  
```

"the probability of it taking more than 2 hours to get to a state from which the long-run probability of at least 5 servers being operational is >0.9"

You can also express various arithmetic expressions such as:

```c
1 - P=? [ F[3600,7200] oper ]  
```

"the probability that the system is **not** operational at any point during the second hour of operation"

```c
R{"oper"}=? [ C<=t ] / t  
```

"the expected fraction of time that the system is available (i.e. the expected interval availability) in the time interval [0, t]"

P=? [ F fail_A ] / P=? [ F any_fail ]  

"the (conditional) probability that component A eventually fails, given that at least one component fails"
