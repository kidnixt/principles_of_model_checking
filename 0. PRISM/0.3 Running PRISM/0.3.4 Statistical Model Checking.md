# Statistical Model Checking

The discrete-event simulator built into PRISM ([[0.3.2 Debugging Models with the Simulator]]) can also be used to generate *approximate* results for PRISM properties, a technique often called ***statistical model checking***. Essentially, this is achieved by *sampling*: generating a large number of random path through the model, evaluating the result of the given properties on each run, and using this information to generate an approximately correct result. 

This approach is particularly useful on very large models when normal model checking is infeasible. This is because discrete-event simulation is performed using the PRISM language model description, without explicitly constructing the corresponding probabilistic model.

> **Currently, statistical model checking can only be applied to `P` or `R`operators and does not support LTL-style path properties or [[0.2.12 Filters|filters]]**
