# Sequential Probability Ratio Test Method

The SPRT method is specifically for bounded prperties, such as `P~p[...]`and is based on *acceptance sampling* techniques [YS02](https://www.prismmodelchecker.org/manual/Main/References#YS02). uses Wald's sequential probability ratio test (SPRT), which generates a succession of samples, deciding on-the-fly when an answer can be given with a sufficiently high confidence.


The parameters of the method are:
- Indifference (delta)
- Type I/II error (alpha/betha)

Consider a property of the form `**P**≥p[...]`. The parameter _delta_ is used as the half-width of an _indifference region_ [p-delta,p+delta].
