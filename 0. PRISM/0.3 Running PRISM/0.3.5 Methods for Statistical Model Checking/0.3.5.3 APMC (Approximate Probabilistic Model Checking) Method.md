# Approximate Probabilistic Model Checking

The APMC method, based on [HLMP04](https://www.prismmodelchecker.org/manual/Main/References#HLMP04), offers a probabilistic guratanee on the accuracy of the approximate value generated for a `P=?` property, based on the *Chernoff-Hoeffding* bound. The parameters of the method are:

- Approximation (epsilon)
- Confidence (delta)
- Number of samples (N)

Letting **X** denote the true result of the query `P=?[...]`and **Y** the approximation generated, we have:

$$\large Prob(|Y-X| \gt epsilon) \lt delta$$

where the parameters are related as follows: 

$$\large N = ln($$
