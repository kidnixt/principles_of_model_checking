# Parallel Composition
The probabilistic model corresponding to a PRISM language description is constructed as the *parallel composition* of its modules. In every state of the model, there is a set of commands (belonging to any of the modules) which are enabled, i.e. whose guardas are satisfied in that state. The choice between which command is performed (i.e. the *scheduling*) depends on the model type. 

For and MDP, as in [[0.1.1 Example 1]] the choice is *nondeterministic*. By way of example, consider state (0, 0) (i.e x = 0 and y = 0). There are two commands enabled, one from each module:


``` c
[] x=0 -> 0.8:(x'=0) + 0.2:(x'=1);
```
``` c
[] y=0 -> 0.8:(y'=0) + 0.2:(y'=1);
```

In state (0, 0) of the MDP, there would be a nondeterministic choice between those two probability distributions:
- `0.8:(0,0) + 0.2:(1,0)` (module `M1` moves)
- `0.8:(0,0) + 0.2:(0,1)` (module `M2` moves)

For a DTMC, the choice is *probabilistic*, each enabled command is selected with **equal probability**. [[0.1.1 Example 1]] was a DTMC, then in state (0, 0) of the model the following probability distribution would result:

- `0.8:(0,0) + 0.1:(1,0) + 0.1:(0,1)`
