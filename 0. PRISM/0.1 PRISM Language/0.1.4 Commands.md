# Commands

The behaviour of each module is described by *commands*, comprising a **guard** and one or more **updates**. The first command of module M1 in our [[0.1.1 Example 1]] is:

``` c
[] x=0 -> 0.8:(x'=0) + 0.2:(x'=1);
```

The guard x=0 indicates that this describes the behaviour of the module when the variable **x** has value 0. The updates (x'=0) and (x'=1) and their associated probabilities state that the value of **x** will remaint at 0 with probability 0.8 and change to 1 with probability 0.2.

The second command:

``` c
[] x=1 & y!=2 -> (x'=2);
```

Illustrates that guards can contain constraints on any variable, not just the ones in that module, i.e. the behaviour of one module can depend on the state of another.

**Updates, however, can only specify values for variables belonging to the module.** In general a module *can read* the variables of any other module, but **only write to its own**. When a command comprises a single update with probability 1.0, the 1.0 can be omitted, as is done in the example above.

If a module has more than one variable, updates describe the new value for each of them. For example, if it had two variables $\large x_1$ and $\large x_2$, a possible command would be:

```c
[] x1=0 & x2>0 & x2<10 -> 0.5:(x1'=1)&(x2'=x2+1) + 0.5:(x1'=2)&(x2'=x2-1);
```

Notice that elements of the updates are concatenated with `&` and that each element must be bracketed individually. If an update does not give a new value for a local variable, it is assumed not to change. As a special case, the keyword **`true`** can be used to denote an update where no variable's value changes, i.e. the following are all equivalent:

``` c
[] x1>10 | x2>10 -> (x1'=x1)&(x2'=x2);  
[] x1>10 | x2>10 -> (x1'=x1);  
[] x1>10 | x2>10 -> true;
```

Finally, it is important to remember that the expressions on the right hand side of each update refer to the state of the model *before* the update occurs. So, for example, this command:

```c
[] x1=0 & x2=1 -> (x1'=2)&(x2'=x1)
```
updates variable $\large x_2$ to 0, not 2.
