## Model Type
PRISM language can be used to describe several types of probabilistic models. To indicate which type is being described, a PRISM model usually includes a model type keyword:

- **dtmc:** discrete-time Markov chain
- **ctmc:** continuous-time Markov chain
- **mdp:** Markov decision process (or probabilistic automaton)
- **pta**: probabilistic timed automaton
- **pomdp:** partially observable Markov decision procress
- **popta:** partially observable probabilistic timed automaton
