# Modules and Variables

The definition of a module contains two parts: its *variables* and its *commands*. The variables describe the possible states that the module can be in; the [[0.1.4 Commands]] describe its behaviour, i.e. the way in which the state changes over time.

In the example above, each module has one integer variable with range [0..2]

```c
x : [0..2] init 0;
```

Notice that the initial value of the variable is also specified. A Boolean variable is declared as follows:

```c
b : bool init false;
```

It is also possible to omit the initial value of a variable, in which case it is assumed to be the lowest value in the range (or *false* for a Boolean). Thus, the variable declarations shown below are equivalent to the ones above.

```c
x : [0..2];
b : bool;
```

We also mention that, for a few kinds of model analysis (typically those based on simulation, such as **approximate model checking** or **fast adaptative simulation**), it is also permissable to use integer variables with unbounded ranges, denoted as:

```c
x : int ;
y : int init 3;
```
