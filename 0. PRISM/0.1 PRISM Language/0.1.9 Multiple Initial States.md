# Multiple Initial States

Typically, a variable declaration specifies the initial value for that variable. The *initial state* for the model is then defined by the initial value for all variables. It is possible, however, to specify that a model has **multiple** initial states. This is done using the `init...endinit` construct, which can be placed anywhere in the file except within a module definition, and removing any initial values from variable declarations.

Between the `init` and `endinit` keywords, there should be a predicate over all the variables of the model. Any state which satisfies this predicate is an initial state.

Consider again [[0.1.1 Example 1]]As it stands, there is a single initial state (0, 0) (i.e. x = 0 and y = 0). If we remove the `init 0` part of both variable declarations and add the following to the end of the file;


``` c
init x=0 endinit
```

there will be three initial states: `(0,0)`, `(0,1)` and `(0,2)`. Similarly, we could instead add:


``` c
init x+y=1 endinit
```

in which case there would be two initial states: `(0,1)` and `(1,0)`.
