# Costs & Rewards

PRISM supports the specification and analysis of properties based on _costs_ and _rewards_. This means that it can be used to reason, not just about the probability that a model behaves in a certain fashion, **but about a wider range of quantitative measures relating to model behaviour.**

For example, PRISM can be used to compute properties such as "expected time", "expected number of lost messages" or "expected power consumption". The implementation of cost- and reward-based techniques in the tool is only partially completed and is still ongoing.
