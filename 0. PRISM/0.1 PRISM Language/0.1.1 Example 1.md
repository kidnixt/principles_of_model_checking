# Example 1

System comprising two identical processes which must operator under mutual exclusion.  Each process can be in one of 3 states: {0,1,2}. From state 0, a process will move to state 1 with probability 0.2 and remain in the same state with probability 0.8. From state 1, it tries to move to the critical section: state 2. This can only occur if the other process is not in its critical section. Finally, from state 2, a process will either remain there or move back to state 0 with equal probability. The PRISM code to describe an MDP model of this system can be seen below. In the next sections, we explain each aspect of the code in turn.

```c
mdp 

module M1

	x : [0..2] init 0;
	[] x=0 -> 0.8:(x'=0) + 0.2:(x'=1)
	[] x=1 & y!=2 -> (x'=2);  
    [] x=2 -> 0.5:(x'=2) + 0.5:(x'=0);
endmodule

module M2  
  
    y : [0..2] init 0;  
  
    [] y=0 -> 0.8:(y'=0) + 0.2:(y'=1);  
    [] y=1 & x!=2 -> (y'=2);  
    [] y=2 -> 0.5:(y'=2) + 0.5:(y'=0);  
  
endmodule

```
