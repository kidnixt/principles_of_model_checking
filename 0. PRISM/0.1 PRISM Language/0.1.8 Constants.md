# Constants
PRISM supports the use of *constants*. Can be integers, doubles or Boolenas and can be defined using literal values or as constant expressions using the `const` keyword.


``` c
const int radius = 12;  
const double pi = 3.141592;  
const double area = pi * radius * radius;  
const bool yes = true;
```

Constants can be used anywhere that a constant value would be expected, such as the lower or upper range of a variable, the probability or rate associated with an update, or anywhere in a guard or update. As will be described later constants can also be left undefined and specified later, either to a single value or a range of values, using [[0.3.6 Experiments]]
