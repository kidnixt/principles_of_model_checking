# The Articles' Ambivalence

Due to issues in the extraction time of other PDFA, an idea arose as a hypothesis: after a branching (when an “or” appears in the regex, e.g.: "He | She" ) if the number of words (tokens) is very large, it will take much longer. On the other hand, if it has few words (three or less), the time will be shorter. Theoretically it didn't seem to make much sense (especially the minimum number of words mentioned above)


try different words using almost the same regex
