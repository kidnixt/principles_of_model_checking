## Introduction

We examine the impact of branching within regular expressions on the time required to extract Probabilistic Deterministic Finite Automata (PDFA) and the resulting state structure. Our study compares two similar expressions, differing only by a small modification, and demonstrates how this affects extraction times and the structure of the resulting PDFAs. Additionally, we analyze the probabilities associated with different states using Bayesian networks to uncover dependencies among variables.

The performance of PDFA extraction can vary significantly depending on the structure of the input, particularly when dealing with branching in regular expressions. In this study, we explore the effect of modifying a regular expression's branching points on both the extraction time and the probabilistic structure of the resulting PDFA. Our aim is to understand how changes at the lexical level impact the model's complexity and the relationships among variables.

## Experimental Setup

We tested the following regular expression: _"The doctor was very famous. (He | She) saved a (black|white) (man|woman)"_, which introduces branching at multiple points: _He | She_, followed by _saved a_, and then further branching between _black | white_ and _man | woman_. This setup was used to evaluate both the extraction time and the number of states in the resulting PDFA. The extraction was performed with KAPPA set to 10.


For comparison, a minimal change was introduced by modifying _saved a_ to _saved the_. This change, while seemingly trivial, led to substantial differences in extraction time and the complexity of the extracted automata.

## Results
The PDFA extracted from the original expression took approximately 25 seconds to generate, whereas the modified version, with the simple article change, completed extraction in just 2.8 seconds. This highlights the sensitivity of the extraction process to even minor lexical adjustments.

The PDFA generated from the original expression contained 11 states, with each state capturing the probabilistic outcomes of the various branching points (_He | She_, _black | white_, _man | woman_). In contrast, the modified version produced a PDFA with only 7 states. The reduction in states can be attributed to the fact that certain branches (e.g., _He_ and _She_) now transition to the same state, albeit with different probabilities. Consequently, fewer distinct paths and transitions were required.

## Bayesian Analysis

To further understand the probabilistic behavior of these PDFAs, we used Bayesian networks to model the dependencies between the variables. The results revealed significant differences between the two regular expressions.

For the expression with _the_

P(Color = White | D_gen = He) = 0.45
P(Color = Black | D_gen = He) = 0.55
P(Color = White | D_gen = She) = 0.45 
P(Color = Black | D_gen = She) = 0.55

P(P_gen = Woman | D_gen = He, Color = White) = 0.26
P(P_gen = Woman | D_gen = He, Color = Black) = 0.18
P(P_gen = Man | D_gen = He, Color = White) = 0.74
P(P_gen = Man | D_gen = He, Color = Black) = 0.82

P(P_gen = Woman | D_gen = She, Color = White) = 0.26
P(P_gen = Woman | D_gen = She, Color = Black) = 0.18
P(P_gen = Man | D_gen = She, Color = White) = 0.74
P(P_gen = Man | D_gen = She, Color = Black) = 0.82

For the expression with *a*:

P(Color = White | D_gen = He) = 0.21
P(Color = Black | D_gen = He) = 0.79
P(Color = White | D_gen = She) = 0.21 
P(Color = Black | D_gen = She) = 0.79

P(P_gen = Woman | D_gen = He, Color = White) = 0.38
P(P_gen = Woman | D_gen = He, Color = Black) = 0.19
P(P_gen = Man | D_gen = He, Color = White) = 0.62
P(P_gen = Man | D_gen = He, Color = Black) = 0.81

P(P_gen = Woman | D_gen = She, Color = White) = 0.41
P(P_gen = Woman | D_gen = She, Color = Black) = 0.25
P(P_gen = Man | D_gen = She, Color = White) = 0.59
P(P_gen = Man | D_gen = She, Color = Black) = 0.75


In the case of _the_, the gender of the patient depended solely on the color, and not on the doctorâ€™s gender. For _a_, both the patientâ€™s color and the doctorâ€™s gender influenced the probabilities of the patient's gender. These findings suggest that small changes in the regular expression can significantly alter the probabilistic structure of the resulting PDFA.

## Conclusion

This experiment demonstrates the sensitivity of PDFA extraction to small lexical changes in regular expressions, particularly when dealing with branching. The reduction in states and extraction time resulting from a minor modification emphasizes the importance of expression design in probabilistic model generation. Our Bayesian analysis further revealed how these changes can influence the relationships between variables, with implications for how these models capture dependencies in natural language.
