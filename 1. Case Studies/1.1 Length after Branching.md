# Length after B

Due to issues in the extraction time of other PDFA, an idea arose as a hypothesis: after a branching (when an “or” appears in the regex, e.g.: "He | She" ) if the number of words (tokens) is very large, it will take much longer. On the other hand, if it has few words (three or less), the time will be shorter. Theoretically it didn't seem to make much sense (especially the minimum number of words mentioned above), but empirically it appeared to hold true.

Using this regex: "The doctor was very famous. (He|She) died yesterday" it takes 1.5 seconds to learn and construct the PDFA. While using this one: "The doctor was very famous. (He|She) died yesterday in a very sad way due to a cardiac arrest." it takes significantly longer, 137.5 seconds. This discrepancy in time could be attributed to the increased complexity of the second regex, which contains more words and thus more potential paths to explore. This observation leads us to try to ensure that whatever comes after a branch “passes” with probability 1.0 and does not need to be processed by the LLM, but that is a story from another tale.
