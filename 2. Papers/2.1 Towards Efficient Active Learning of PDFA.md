# Towards Efficient Active Learning of PDFA

## Introduction
The learner's purpose is to unveil the hidden target automaton only known to the teacher. The latter allows the former to ask two kinds of questions, namely *membership* (**MQ**) and *equivalence* (**EQ**) queries.

**MQ** seeks to discover the automaton's outcome for a particular string. Originally, the purpose of **MQ** is to know whether a string belongs to the language to be learnt or, equivalently, whether it is accepted by the associated automaton. The answer may not be Boolean. The same approach is followed in [15] where **MQ** is used to refer to the function that returns the probability of the last symbol in a string.

**EQ** provides means for determining to what extent the hypothesis automaton produced by the learner approximates the target one. This query checks whether they both produce the same outcome to **MQ** for all strings. When **MQ** are not binary, such as for PDFA, it could be useful to relax equality in order to learn *similar* hypotheses that tolerate small discrepancies. For instance, in [5, 12, 15] equality is replaced by a *similarity* relation. However, that similarity relation is not an equivalence as it lacks transitivity. 

Based on these observations, we formulate a learning framework for PDFA where the teacher's to **MQ** are probability distributions over the symbols a string could be continued with. These are called *next-symbol* probability distributions. Besides, in the case the learner is allowed to produce hypotheses whose next-symbol probability distributions are approximations of the target ones, we propose to resort to *quantization* as an abstraction which allows us to define a coarser equivalence relation than the latter. 

## PDFA

Let $\large\Sigma$ be a finite *alphabet* and $\large\Sigma_{\$}$ to be the set $\large\Sigma \cup \{\$\}$, where $ is a special *terminal* symbol not in $\large\Sigma$. $\large\Delta(\Sigma_{\$})$ is a probability simplex over $\large\Sigma_{\$}$ (conjunto que contiene todas las posibles distribuciones de probabilidad sobre los elementos, cada distribución asigna una probabilidad no negativa a cada símbolo).

A PDFA *A* over $\large\Sigma$ is a tuple $\large (Q, q_{\text{in}}, \pi, \tau)$, where $\large \pi : Q \to \Delta(\Sigma_{\$})$ associates a probability distribution over $\large \Sigma_{\$}$ with each state in $\large Q$. 

The function $\large \tau : Q \times \Sigma \to \Delta(Q)$ is a probabilistic transition function, mapping each state and symbol to a probability distribution over the states.
