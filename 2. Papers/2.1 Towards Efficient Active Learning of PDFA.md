# Towards Efficient Active Learning of PDFA

## Introduction
The learner's purpose is to unveil the hidden target automaton only known to the teacher. The latter allows the former to ask two kinds of questions, namely *membership* (**MQ**) and *equivalence* (**EQ**) queries.

**MQ** seeks to discover the automaton's outcome for a particular string. Originally, the purpose of **MQ** is to know whether a string belongs to the language to be learnt or, equivalently, whether it is accepted by the associated automaton. The answer may not be Boolean. The same approach is followed in [15] where **MQ** is used to refer to the function that returns the probability of the last symbol in a string.

**EQ** provides means for determining to what extent the hypothesis automaton produced by the
